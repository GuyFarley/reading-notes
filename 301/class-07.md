# Code 301 - Class 07 - REST

## [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

1. **Who is Roy Fielding?**
  Roy Fielding helped create the first web servers, and his name is on the specification for HTTP (the protocol that sends pages from servers to web browsers)

2. **Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?** Because they were designed to be able to talk to a small group of machines. Now, we need to be able to communicate with all computers about everything that's on other computers

3. **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?** It is a way of applying "verbs" to "nouns". In other words, it allows us to tell computers what to do with the resources we ask them to get on the web.

4. **What does a GET do?** It allows a web browser to obtain resources from another computer

5. **What does a POST do?** Allows a system to add something to another system

6. **What does PUT do?** Replaces something on another computer

7. **What does PATCH do?** It does a partial update on another computer
