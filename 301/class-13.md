# Code 301 - Class 13 - More CRUD

## [CRUD Basics](https://medium.com/geekculture/crud-operations-explained-2a44096e9c88)

1. **Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?** `PUT`

2. **Which REST methods require an ID parameter?** `PUT` and `DELETE`

## [Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzNcBhSv1Wo)

1. **Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?**

While CRUD is a cycle that gives a database what it needs to be fully functional, it was designed to be mapped to REST - which is an architectural system created around HTTP protocols for accessing resources on the web

2. **If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?**

Wasn't able to get this from the video, I think, so according to [restfulapi.net](https://restfulapi.net/rest-api-design-tutorial-with-example/#more-actions):

> 1. Identify Object Model
> 2. Create Model URIs
> 3. Determine Representations
> 4. Assign HTTP Methods
> 5. More Actions
