# Code 201 - Class 14b - What Google Learned About Teams

## [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

- In the example that starts off the NYT article, a woman describes she had joined two different teams at Yale: one was a study group that Yale had constructed with like-minded indviduals, and the other was a team that joined voluntarily and was much more diverse. The more diverse team functioned much better as a group. Why?
- Google began a study called Project Aristotle in 2012, with the goal of determining what factors create the most productive team of employees
- Initially, it was impossible to find patterns that led to more productivity
- After more than a year, the project's researchers concluded that the key to improving a team's productivity was understanding and influencing **group norms**
- Is there a collective I.Q. that a team will develop that is different from the I.Q.'s of each team member?
- In the study, all the good teams generally shared these behaviors:
  - Members spoke about the same amount during group conversation. The collective intelligence of a group would decline if the conversation was dominated by one or two people
  - The team members were good at intuiting other members' emotions based on their nonverbal cues, tone of voice, etc.
- On these types of teams, "the sum will be greater than its parts".
- **Psychological Safety**, according to Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson, is "a shared belief by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking".

> "Psychological safety is ‘‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,’’ Edmondson wrote in a study published in 1999. ‘‘It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.’’

- The results of this project was the understanding that *psychological safety was the most critical factor in creating an effective team*
