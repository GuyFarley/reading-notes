# Markdown in Github


### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a simple coding language that allows you to quickly format documents and create basic websites on GitHub, without the need for extensive HTML. It streamlines the process of creating clean, readable documentation to accompany coding files that are uploaded to GitHub. While the syntax is very straightforward, it allows for formatting that is quite robust!


### Example #1

> An ordered list might require the following HTML code:
> ```
> <ol>
>   <li>First item</li>
>   <li>Second item</li>
>   <li>Third item</li>
>   <li>Fourth item</li>
> </ol>
> ```
> 
>But this same ordered list can instead be formatted in GitHub by simply writing out the list as follows:
> ```
> 1. First item
> 2. Second item
> 3. Third item
> 4. Fourth item
> ```
> This will render as:
> 
> 1. First item
> 2. Second item
> 3. Third item
> 4. Fourth item


### Example #2

> Links can be created quite easily in Markdown by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ):
> ```
> Be sure to follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/GuyFarley)!
> ```
> This will render as:
> Be sure to follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/GuyFarley)!



Markdown is definitely worth learning if you plan to work in GitHub regularly--it's an easy way to elevate all your documentation and help you stand out amongst the competition!
