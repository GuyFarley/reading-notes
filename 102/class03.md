### What is Git?

Git is a version control system (a Distributed Version Control System or DVCS, to be more specific) that allows much greater control over versions of a coding file. This is a huge help when multiple people are working on the same file, and also helps to easily correct mistakes.

### How does it work?

Git makes use of repositories, which are collections of files that Git is told to pay attention to. These are similar to a directory, but are specific to Git. Within these repositories, each time a new version (or "commit") of a file is saved, Git creates a snapshot of the file. This snapshot can then be accessed at any time.

Repositories can be cloned as well, to be saved on both a local computer and a remote server (such as GitHub). This creates greater security and flexibility when working on and storing repositories.

The Git DVCS makes it incredibly difficult to lose data or make irreversible mistakes, which is fantastic for coders everywhere! For a great read on the subject of Git, check out Udemy's [Git Tutorial: A Comprehensive Guide](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/)
