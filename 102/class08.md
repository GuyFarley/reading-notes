# Class 08: Just enough math, logic, and computer architecture

## Express yourself! With expressions and operators...

Let's talk about a couple of operators often used in JavaScript: Assignment operators and Comparison operators.

**Assignment operators** assign a value to the left operand based on the value of the right operand
- Example: *x = f()*

*Compound assignment operators* also exist, to be used as shorthand for more complex operations.
- Example: *x += f()* is the same as *x = x + f()*

**Comparison operators** are different from assignment operators in that they compare the left and right operands and return a logical value based on whether or not the comparison in *true*.

## Feeling a little loopy?

You're not alone, trust me! Loops are difficult things to wrap your head around. While there are many types of loops in JavaScript, they all basically do the same thing: repeat an action some number of times. Obviously, this comes in quite handy for computer programming!

**For loops** and **while loops**

A *for loop* repeats until a specified condition evaluates to "false". This type of loop will run a **pre-determined number of times**. *for loops* will be written in this format:
```
for([initialExpression];[conditionExpression];[incrementExpression])
    statement
```
You'll want to use a *for loop* when doing something to each item in a list, doing something a specific number of times, if building a counter, etc. 

A *while loop*, on the other hand, executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. This type of loop will run an undetermined number of times. You'll want to use this type of loop for repeating a task for as long as some condition is true. *while loops* will be written in this format:
```
while(condition)
    statement
```
With functions and loops in the mix, we can now start to see how powerful JavaScript can potentially be! Even with these basic tools, we now have the power to create new commands for a computer to follow. Can you feel the power?
