## Wireframing

*Wireframing* is a process that allows you to plan the layout and interface of a site without getting distracted by the details of more advanced design work that will happen later. 

It's usually advantageous to start with sketching out a wireframe, then switch later to a software program to hammer out the details.
Some great online tools for wireframing are:
 - UXPin
 - InVision
 - Wireframe.cc

According to CareerFoundry's [The Definitive Guide: How To Make Your First Wireframe](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/) there are **six steps** to follow when making a wireframe:
1. **Do your research.** Understand your audience, requirements, case studies, etc.
2. **Prep this research for quick reference** (so it will be easy to find good examples, features, etc.).
3. **Map out your user flow.** This will help users to be self-sufficient, and will help the site flow more effectively.
4. **Draft and sketch.** Focus on outlining features and formats, NOT illustrating in fine detail. Some questions to keep in mind:
> * How to organize content to support users' goals?
> * Which info is most prominent?
> * What will user expect to see on certain areas of page?
> * Which buttons/touch points are needed for the user to complete desired actions?
5. **Add detail and TEST!** You're not adding full contents yet, just beefing up the details of each element. Think simplicity, usability, trust-building, and tooltips.
6. **Turn your wireframe into a prototype.** You can use software such as Sketch and Figma to do this.

The same article also notes **three key principles** to keep in mind:
1. **Clarity**
2. **Confidence**
3. **Simplicity**
