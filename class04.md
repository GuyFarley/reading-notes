# Structure web pages with HTML

## Wireframing

*Wireframing* is a process that allows you to plan the layout and interface of a site without getting distracted by the details of more advanced design work that will happen later. 

It's usually advantageous to start with sketching out a wireframe, then switch later to a software program to hammer out the details.
Some great online tools for wireframing are:
 - UXPin
 - InVision
 - Wireframe.cc

According to CareerFoundry's [The Definitive Guide: How To Make Your First Wireframe](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/) there are **six steps** to follow when making a wireframe:
1. **Do your research.** Understand your audience, requirements, case studies, etc.
2. **Prep this research for quick reference** (so it will be easy to find good examples, features, etc.).
3. **Map out your user flow.** This will help users to be self-sufficient, and will help the site flow more effectively.
4. **Draft and sketch.** Focus on outlining features and formats, NOT illustrating in fine detail. Some questions to keep in mind:
> * How to organize content to support users' goals?
> * Which info is most prominent?
> * What will user expect to see on certain areas of page?
> * Which buttons/touch points are needed for the user to complete desired actions?
5. **Add detail and TEST!** You're not adding full contents yet, just beefing up the details of each element. Think simplicity, usability, trust-building, and tooltips.
6. **Turn your wireframe into a prototype.** You can use software such as Sketch and Figma to do this.

The same article also notes **three key principles** to keep in mind:
1. **Clarity**
2. **Confidence**
3. **Simplicity**

## HTML Basics and Semantics

HTML = HyperText Markup Language. This is the language that is used to build the contents of a web page as viewed in a browser. 

HTML is made up of several elements, which are used to make content look a certain way on the page. 

**Anatomy of an HTML element**
1. Opening tag
2. Closing tag
3. Content

When these individual elements are combined in the right way, they form a complete HTML page. This full HTML document is rendered by the browser to display text, images, lists, etc. on the page the way the website creator meant for it to be seen. 

Semantics refers to the meaning of a code element--in other words, what purpose does the code have?

As noted in MDN's article on [Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics), Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:

> - Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see [SEO](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO))
> - Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
> - Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes
> - Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
> - Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming

It's always best to keep the role the code will play in mind when determining which markup to use. This will help to use the markup that will provide the most benefit for the data itself.
