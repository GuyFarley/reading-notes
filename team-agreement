## The Special Objects

- Guy Farley
- Jeffery Johnson
- Jon Armstrong
- Vinny Shipley

### Cooperation Plan

**What are the key strengths of each person on the team?**

- **Guy:** Handling Ambiguity. Project Execution. Integrity.
- **Jeffery:** Curiosity. Integrity.
- **Vinny:** Adaptability. Collaboration. Agile.
- **Jon:** Curiosity. Constant Improvement. Root Cause Resolution.

**How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?**

- **Guy** can use his experience in project management to help focus workflow and organize tasks. He can also try to help identify actions from ambiguous information.
- **Jeffery** can help with asking questions and thinking of ways to improve upon ideas.
- **Vinny** can help by jumping in to help with issues that arise, adapting and reprioritizing as needed.
- **Jon** can help with asking additional questions and thinking outside the box to help implement the tools we have.

**In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?**

- **Guy:** Developing a better imagination for how to use the tools that I have, and think outside the box.
- **Jeffery:** Being able to focus on specific tasks while working on a project.
- **Vinny:** To build organizational skills when planning out and executing a project. Starting out with a solid scaffold and filling in details.
- **Jon:** Improve time-management and prioritization.

**Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?**

### Conflict Plan

**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**

- Vote among team if disagreement arises. Team discussion. Willingness to compromise will be agreed upon up front.

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**

- By keeping open dialogue and communication. Speaking up as early as possible if we feel this is happening. Turn it into a learning opportunity if one member seems very competent in a particular area.

**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

- Tolerance and communication. Acceptance of varying skill levels. We will redistribute workload as needed, but also push each other to work through the problem rather than just taking over or giving the answer. Treat it as learning opportunity.

**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**

- Direct communication with that team member. Address in project reviews to stay on top of it. Determine the root cause so we can address the underlying issue and pivot as needed.

**How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**

- Escalate to Audrey for help.

### Communication Plan

**What hours will you be available to communicate?**

- **Guy:** PST. Most effective before 9pm (but can flex). Dog walk break around 3:30pm.
- **Jeffery:** EST. Available most hours.
- **Vinny:** PST. Available most hours.
- **Jon:** PST. Available most hours.

*General working hours will be 9am to noon PST. Break mid-day. 1pm to 6pm.*

- **Project Review** around mid-day and possibly at end of day - To recap progress and pin down tasks to be completed next. Talk about status (are we on track or falling behind?).

**What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?**

- Slack for most communication.

**How often will you take breaks?**

- 10 minutes every hour. Mid-day lunch break. Mid-afternoon break.

**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**

- Discuss as a team to redistribute, gang up on an issue, etc.. Then escalate to Audrey if needed.

**How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**

- Slack messages.

**What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**

- "Round Robin" during project review meetings, making sure everyone shares thoughts and feedback.

**How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**

- Communication schedule, group accountability, maintaining awareness of everyone's involvement, and encouraging each other to speak their minds and provide their thoughts.

### Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

**How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**

- We will identify these tasks during the project review meetings and determine how we will approach each task. We will determine during these meetings what each task will require, as far as pair programming, group programming, or individual work.
- We can start on a voluntary basis, then discuss as a group
- Rough HTML structure decided as a group
- Will break down problem domain into smallest steps possible, then figure out who wants to tackle each subset of tasks

**What project management tool will be used?**

- GitHub Projects

### Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

**What components of your project will live on GitHub?**

- Most likely everything

**How will you share the repository with your teammates?**

- Will set up the Organization, then create the project repo. Then everyone will be a collaborator on that

**What is your Git flow?**

- Will create a dev branch off the main branch, then each of us will have a separate branch that we use to push up to dev branch
- We will discuss as a group before pushing anything from the dev branch up to the main branch

**Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:**

> **How many people must review a PR?**

- 2 people, but will actually be the entire team since we plan to discuss as a team before all PR's

> **Who merges PRs?**

- We will take turns merging PR's to make sure we all get practice

> **How often will you merge?**

- On task completion or changing hands. Most likely will discuss during project review meetings, and agree to merge at that time

> **How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?**

- We will discuss as a group and agree that it's time to merge

### Schedule your practice session

Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”
