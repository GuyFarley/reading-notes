# The Coder's Computer

## Choosing a Text Editor

Code is written in text, so any old text editor should work for writing code--right? Not so! While text editors like Notepad or MS Word are great for taking notes or word processing, they lack many features that are helpful to a coder. Features such as code completion (auto completing lines of code as you write them) and a wide variety of extensions to perform various coding functions are key when choosing a text editor. 

Some great text editors that include coding-specific features include:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
- [TextWrangler/BB Edit](https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)

## Terminals and File Navigation

A terminal (or command line) allows you to navigate all the various folders (or directories) on your computer. While the terminal interface is not nearly as intuitive as the graphical user interface you might typically use to navigate your machine (like Windows or MacOS), it allows for tighter control over the files you are working with. This comes in very handy to a coder. 

The terminal allows you to move throughout various directories and files using simple commands. A few examples are:

- ls - lists the contents of the directory you're currently in
- cd - change directory (moves to the directory noted after "cd")
- pwd - tells the user which directory they are currently in
