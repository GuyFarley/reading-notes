### How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

- Node is a program that allows us (as developers) to run JavaScript on our computers. It's built on top of an existing "engine" program that translates our JavaScript code into a language the computer can understand. Node also allows us to use a lot of different tools for writing our code, and for running it on the back end. This makes our lives much easier, since we can write everything in JS and still work between front ends and back ends.

1. Running build tools for JavaScript
