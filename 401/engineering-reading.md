# Engineering Readings

## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I have a decent amount of experience solving real-world problems in the fields of marketing and production -- Problems involving budgets, supply chain, logistics, timelines, production/manufacturing processes, personnel, clients, and so on.

While I recognize that software development will require me to master a specific type of problem solving, I think the skills I have developed in my career will allow me to approach and solve problems differently than those with a strictly technical background.

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. Reassess the problem to see if there's a different way of thinking about it that might help me to solve it more easily

2. Solve the problem manually, then write comments or pseudo-code for the manual steps

3. "Gameify" the problem, to help maintain motivation and reduce stress in that moment
