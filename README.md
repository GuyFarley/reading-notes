# Guy's Reading Notes

## This is my learning journal for Code Fellows.

### Introduction
My name is Guy Farley (he/him) and I live in Bend, OR where I enjoy fly fishing and mountain biking. My background is in project management for marketing, but I've decided to shift to a career in tech. I'm very excited for this journey!

### Growth Mindset

A *growth mindset* is the frame of mind which allows you to achieve goals that may seem difficult (or impossible) at first. It is an understanding that intelligence is not static, but instead can be developed. It is the knowledge that obstacles and failures will happen, but that you have the ability to work through them and learn from them to become better. 

### 3 Reminders to Myself

1. **Challenges should be embraced!** These are what will stretch my abilities.
2. **Failure is the best teacher.** I should expect to find myself in "The Learning Pit" often, and will learn the most from climbing out of it.
3. **Criticism is a great learning tool.** Don't ignore or take it personally, but instead use it to improve my methods and attitude.
