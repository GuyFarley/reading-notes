## My Learning Journal for Code Fellows

This site is dedicated to my thoughts and learnings as I progress through the Code Fellows Software Development program. Please use the table of contents below for navigating my posts.

## Introduction

Hello, my name is Guy Farley (he/him). I live in Bend, Oregon, where I enjoy fly fishing and mountain biking. My background is in project management for marketing but I've decided to shift to a career in tech. I'm very excited for this journey!
